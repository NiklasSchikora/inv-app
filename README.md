# Inventory App ðŸ“š

This is a demo project, created by me in order of a assignment for my studies at the [DHBW Mosbach](https://www.mosbach.dhbw.de/). The assignment was about utilizing modern web-API's to use the browser as an attractive plattform-alternative opposing to native app development. In the demo-application a prototype for an inventory application was developed.

## Using / installing the project

The project is built as vanilla-wev application. To use or install the project, simply clone it and open the desired page-file in a browser.

Alternatively, the supplied ddev-container can be used to provide a local development server. To start up, make sure ddev is installed properly. Then simply run

```
ddev start
```

to boot up the container. For help on this, check the [ddev-documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
